The number of the page to show. Minimum 1, maximum 1000.
}
  \item{include_adult}{
Toggle the inclusion of adult titles. Expected value is: true or false
}
  \item{search_type}{
By default, the search type is 'phrase'. This is almost guaranteed the option you will want. It's a great all purpose search type and by far the most tuned for every day querying. For those wanting more of an "autocomplete" type search, set this option to 'ngram'.
